## üö® Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs).

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [nicholasadamou.com](https://nicholasadamou.com). Thanks!

## üõ† Installation & Set Up

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (recommended)

### Steps

1. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## üöÄ Building and Running for Production

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `yarn preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
